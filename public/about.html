  About Me
  
  Hi! I’m a 27-year-old Asian girl living in Poland, currently diving headfirst into the world of coding — and yes, sometimes I feel like I’m debugging my entire life 😅.
  
  I speak four languages, which basically means I can confuse myself in multiple ways — very efficiently! My friends call me “little meerkat” because I have big, round, almond-shaped eyes and I’m always looking around like I’m on a secret mission. (Spoiler: it’s usually just finding snacks or the semicolon I forgot in my code.)
  
  Poland has taught me to love pierogi, appreciate snow (kind of), and fear the phrase “let’s go for a walk” in winter. When I’m not coding or studying, you’ll probably find me making chaotic playlists, rewatching Studio Ghibli movies, or pretending I know what I’m doing in life. (Plot twist: I don’t, but I do it with style.)
  
  So if you need a multilingual meerkat with a keyboard and questionable coffee habits — that’s me!

  Want it to sound more professional, more silly, or a mix of both?</p>
